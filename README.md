## Overview

async is a C library for Linux and macOS that provides:
- a single-threaded main loop that dispatches callback events
- edge-triggered file-descriptor monitoring (using Linux `epoll(2)` or BSD
  `kqueue(2)` system calls)
- timers
- TCP client and server connections
- other useful byte streams

## Building

async uses [SCons][] and `pkg-config` for building and depends on the following
libraries:
- [encjson][]
- [fsdyn][]
- [fstrace][]
- [unixkit][]

Before building async for the first time, run
```
git submodule update --init
```

To build async, run
```
scons [ prefix=<prefix> ]
```
from the top-level async directory. The prefix argument is a directory,
`/usr/local` by default, where the build system searches for async
dependencies and installs async.

To install async, run
```
sudo scons [ prefix=<prefix> ] install
```

## The Structure of an Async Application

Here is the skeleton of a simple `async` application:
```
#include <async/async.h>

typedef struct {
    async_t *async;
    int fd;
    /*...*/
} my_app_t;

static void process_event(my_app_t *app)
{
    char buf[100];
    ssize_t count = read(app->fd, buf, sizeof buf);
    /*...*/
}

static void initialize(my_app_t *app)
{
    app->fd = my_channel_open(/*...*/);
    action_1 callback = { app, (act_1) process_event };
    int status = async_register(app->async, app->fd, callback);
    if (status < 0) {
        /* see errno */
    }
    async_execute(app->async, callback);    /* the first time's on us */
}

int main(void)
{
    my_app_t app;
    app.async = make_async();
    initialize(&app);
    async_loop(app.async);
    destroy_async(app.async);   /* if you want */
    return 0;
}
```
Notes:
- A single `async` object is created for the lifetime of the process.
- The `async_loop()` function blocks "for ever" (use `async_quit_loop()` to exit
  the loop).
- One or more file descriptors are handed to `async` with `async_register()`.
  Only socket-like ("selectable") file descriptors are suitable.
- Registration makes the file descriptor nonblocking as a side effect.
- Event handlers must never sleep or block but must return ASAP. Use state
  machines to manage control flow.
- A file descriptor is only guaranteed a notification when its I/O state changes
  after registration. Initially, it is considered readable and writable. If
  `read()`, `recv*()`, `accept()`, `write()`, `send*()` or `connect()` returns
  with `EAGAIN` or `EINPROGRESS`, the I/O state changes and the application can
  rely on a callback as soon as the file operation should be tried again. That
  is why the sample application above uses `async_execute()` to schedule the
  callback during initialization.
- The application is responsible for exhausting its inputs before a callback is
  guaranteed. However, care must be taken so the application does not spin in a
  loop servicing one file descriptor for ever. At times, control should be
  relinquished to other activities. Resume reading the input by calling
  `async_execute()` before returning from the callback.
- Callbacks may be spurious.
- `async_loop()` returns a negative integer (with `errno` set) in case of an I/O
  error. In particular, a signal will make `async_loop()` return with `EINTR`.

## Timers and Tasks
You start a timer with
```
async_timer_t *my_timer =
    async_timer_start(app->async, async_now(app->async) + 5 * ASYNC_S,
    (action_1) { app, (act_1) callback });
```
which causes `callback(app)` to be called by `async` 5 seconds from now. Note
that the expiry is expressed as a point in time instead of a delay;
`async_now()` returns an unsigned, non-wrapping, ever-increasing nanosecond
counter. If it refers to the past, the timer expires immediatelyâ€”however, the
callback is always invoked from `async_loop()` and not from
`async_timer_start()`.

A running timer can be canceled with `async_timer_cancel(async, timer)`.
Canceling a non-running timer is a sure way to crash the process.

If you want a task executed right away, call `async_execute(async, callback)`. A
direct function call is more immediate, of course, but "backgrounding" tasks
often has benefits: you can complete state transitions before the scheduled
action is taken and multiple activities are interleaved fairly by the main loop.

Like `async_timer_start()`, `async_execute()` returns a timer object.
It is usually ignored but could be used by the application to cancel
the pending action before it is executed.

## Notifications

The `<async/notification.h>` module provides a notification object that wraps an
action and can safely schedule it from a signal handler or separate thread. You
create a notification with
```
notification_t *my_notification =
    make_notification(app->async, (action_1) { app, (act_1) callback });
```
The notification can be issued at any time with
`issue_notification(my_notification)` and can be destroyed with
`destroy_notification(my_notification)`.

## Byte Streams and Yields
`async` includes a collection of byte stream and yield types. The types are
implemented in C++'esque C which allows for interfaces and virtual functions.

A byte stream type implements the `<async/bytestream_1.h>` interface. That is,
any byte stream object can be "typecast" into a `bytestream_1` object with a
function. Thus, a chunk encoder object is converted into a `bytestream_1` object
with `chunkencoder_as_bytestream_1(encoder)` and a pacer stream object is
converted with `pacerstream_as_bytestream_1(pacer)`.

(Interface types sport a numeric tag. An interface never changes. If a change is
needed, the numeric tag is incremented, and both versions of the interface
remain valid.)

The `bytestream_1` interface has four methods:
- `ssize_t read(void *stream, void *buf, size_t count)`

- `void close(void *stream)`

- `void register_callback(void *stream, action_1 action)`

- `void unregister_callback(void *stream)`

Each byte stream type additionally contains a constructor to create an object of
the type, and the `bytestream_1` methods as functions prefixed with the type
name.

The semantics of the methods is mostly obvious. The `close()` function acts as a
destructor for the object. (Closed stream objects become inactive immediately
and are deallocated by the main loop.)

Byte streams are often chained much like Unix pipelines for similarly diverse
effects.

A yield is a sequence of arbitrary data objects, typically driven by I/O events.
A yield type implements the `<async/yield_1.h>` interface. That is, any yield
object can be "typecast" into a `yield_1` object with a function.

Similarly to the byte stream interface, the `yield_1` interface has four
methods:
- `void *receive(void *yield)`

- `void close(void *yield)`

- `void register_callback(void *yield, action_1 action)`

- `void unregister_callback(void *yield)`

The `receive` method returns an object whose type depends on the specific yield.
Each yield type additionally contains a constructor to create an object of the
type, and the `yield_1` methods as functions prefixed with the type name.

A yield is usually implemented on top of a byte stream that decodes a single
object out of a source stream.

A yield of frames delimited with "naive" encoding. The yield input is a
`bytestream_1` object and the outputs are `bytestream_1` objects.

## JSON decoder

The `<async/jsondecoder.h>` module provides an object that decodes a single JSON
object from a byte stream. As opposed to other decoders, the JSON decoder is not
a byte stream.

## TCP
The `<async/tcp_connection.h>` module integrates TCP (and Unix stream socket)
connections with `async` and the byte stream mechanism. A TCP connection is
presented as a pair of byte streams. The TCP connection supplies a byte stream
for receiving bytes from the socket. The application must supply a byte stream
for sending bytes to the socket. Thus, bytes are only read, never written. A
typical usage pattern is to supply the TCP connection with an outbound queue
stream and send messages with the `queuestream_enqueue()` function.

To create a TCP (or Unix stream socket) client, call `tcp_connect()`,
`tcp_register_callback()` and `tcp_set_output_stream()`.

To create a TCP (or Unix stream socket) server, call `tcp_listen()`,
`tcp_register_server_callback()` and `tcp_accept()`.

To create a socket pair, call `socketpair()` followed by
`tcp_adopt_connection()`.

Note that `tcp_close()` closes both associated byte streams. You can close the
byte streams individually using the `bytestream_1` facilities, or, use the
`tcp_shut_down()` method. Even after both byte streams have been closed/shut
down, `tcp_close()` needs to be called to free up the resources.
